## Welcome to my personal dev-space!

Hi, I'm Cayetano Martínez-Muriel, Aerodynamics & Aeroelasticity Engineer and Researcher

PhD in Computational Aerodynamics & Aeroelasticity (Univ. Carlos III Madrid)

- I focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics and Structures 🛩️🍃 - ▲🏗️
- I code daily in ```.py```, ```.m```, and sometimes dive into ```.f```, ```.f90```, ```.c```, ```.cpp```.

Slowly filling this space with projects, solvers, and ideas — stay tuned!
