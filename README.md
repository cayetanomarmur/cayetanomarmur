## $\text{Welcome to my personal {\color{#900025}dev}-{\color{#5871D0}space}!}$

<center>Hi, I'm an Aerodynamics & Aeroelasticity Engineer and Researcher.</center>\
<center>PhD in Computational Aerodynamics and CFD with focus on Python and HPC @ Univ. Carlos III Madrid.</center>

<center>🛩️🍃💧💨 I focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics (RANS, DNS) and Nonlinear Structural Analysis ▲🏗️</center>\
<center>⚙️ Specialized in developing parallel code for High-Performance Computing (HPC), scaling CFD-FEM coupled simulations</center>\
<center>💻 I code daily in ```.py```, ```.m```, and sometimes dive into ```.f```, ```.f90```, ```.c```, ```.cpp```.</center>\
<center>📂 Slowly filling this space with projects, solvers, and ideas — stay tuned!</center>
