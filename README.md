## Welcome to my personal dev-space!

Hi, I'm an Aerodynamics & Aeroelasticity Engineer and Researcher.

🛩️🍃💧💨 I focus on Computational Fluid Dynamics (RANS, DNS) and Nonlinear Structural Analysis ▲🏗️
⚙️ Specialized in developing parallel code for High-Performance Computing (HPC), scaling CFD-FEM coupled simulations
💻 I code daily in ```.py```, ```.m```, and sometimes dive into ```.f```, ```.f90```, ```.c```, ```.cpp```.
📂 Slowly filling this space with projects, solvers, and ideas — stay tuned!
